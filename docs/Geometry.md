# Geometry

The core geometry of this code is just the Affine Group of $\mathbb{R}^2$, $\text{GA(2)}$. Simple quality of life operations included as well.

## Polygons 

The Polygon class, defined over objects of the geometry class, is simple an array of vertices.  Within the header, there are the necessary functions to define, classify, and manipulate Polygon objects within $\mathbb{R}^2$, as well as provide the necessary information to decompose, sum, and compute convex hulls. There are also utility functions, mostly for unit testing and easy object creation.
